# Update Checker

WPF app to check if a website changed its HTML content!
I needed it to be notified when tickets for a show started to sell.

### Features

- Starts with Windows
- Minimize to Tray
- Notifies when website changes (toast-like)
- Auto updates every x minutes
- Save config and last query on folder


### Hey

- .NET 4.5 required
- Made in 11 hours according to WakaTime, so maybe it has some bugs
- Compares HTML content only, sites with dynamic content change it every request for every different user
- System tray icon doesn't disappear after closing the program. Looks like it is normal Windows behavior...

### Changelog

0.9.1
- Auto update stops when website changes (no false positives anymore) and icon on system tray gets red
- About window with credits inside
- Minor tweaks

0.9
First release
